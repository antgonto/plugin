socketio4net
============

## Please Note - This project is no longer maintained






SocketIO4Net.Client is a .NET 4.0 &amp; v4.5 (C#) client for Socket.IO.  It provides an overall interface similar to a client JavaScript experience.

My goal for this project is a simple & familiar experience for .net clients.  You know you want your .Net app to join in some of the fun, right?  Besides, all the cool kids are using Nodejs and Socket.IO these days anyway, give it a whirl.

## Development Branch

The Development branch contains WIP code that support for xhr-polling in addition to websocket support.  

### New Additions

#### Xhr-polling 
Support for Xhr-Polling available. Based on the transports supported at the socket.io server end, websocket and xhr-polling will be used to connect automatically. You can also define a specific transport, if desired:  

`socket.Connect(); // auto-connect via websocket or xhr-polling (as fall back)`  
`socket.Connect(TransportType.XhrPolling); // force XhrPolling`  

#### Dashboard 
A new dashboard for demo & debug has also been added to samples/node.sever.  

![dashboard](http://jstott.github.io/socketio4net/images/dashboard-550x335.jpg)

From VS2012/VS2013, compile and start the the Samples/Console_Events project after you have started the samples/node.server.  

* [Enable Nuget package restore](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages) in Visual Studio, and for the solution.

* In order to run the samples/node.server dashboard - you will need to run `npm install` in that directory initially.
>* `install.cmd` will run npm install for you  

* `startServer.cmd` will then run the nodejs server, and launch a chrome windwo to http://localhost:3000/
* `debugServer.cmd` will run node-inspector, launch chrome, and allow you to run a debug session against the server

* _At this time, Nuget packages have not yet been updated_

This resulting signature is very similar to the socket.io javascript counterpart:

## node.js / JavaScript client

			socket.on('news', function (data) {
				console.log(data);
			});

## C# .net client

			socket.On("news", (data) =>    {
				Console.WriteLine(data);
			});

The all important - Sample / Demo code snippet 

			Client socket;
			public void Execute()
			{
				Console.WriteLine("Starting TestSocketIOClient Example...");

				socket = new Client("http://127.0.0.1:3000/"); // url to nodejs 
				socket.Opened += SocketOpened;
				socket.Message += SocketMessage;
				socket.SocketConnectionClosed += SocketConnectionClosed;
				socket.Error += SocketError;
            
				// register for 'connect' event with io server
				socket.On("connect", (fn) =>
				{
					Console.WriteLine("\r\nConnected event...\r\n");
					Console.WriteLine("Emit Part object");

					// emit Json Serializable object, anonymous types, or strings
					Part newPart = new Part() 
					{ PartNumber = "K4P2G324EC", Code = "DDR2", Level = 1 };
					socket.Emit("partInfo", newPart);
				});

				// register for 'update' events - message is a json 'Part' object
				socket.On("update", (data) =>
				{
					Console.WriteLine("recv [socket].[update] event");
					//Console.WriteLine("  raw message:      {0}", data.RawMessage);
					//Console.WriteLine("  string message:   {0}", data.MessageText);
					//Console.WriteLine("  json data string: {0}", data.Json.ToJsonString());
					//Console.WriteLine("  json raw:         {0}", data.Json.Args[0]);
                
					// cast message as Part - use type cast helper
					Part part = data.Json.GetFirstArgAs<Part>();
					Console.WriteLine(" Part Level:   {0}\r\n", part.Level);
				});

				// make the socket.io connection
				socket.Connect();
			}
